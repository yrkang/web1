 <h2>WEB</h2>
 The <strong>World Wide Web</strong>, also known as the WWW and the Web, is
 an information space where documents and other web resources are identified
 by <u>Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)</u>, interlinked by hypertext links,
 and accessible via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented
 the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990
 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland. The browser was released
 outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting
 in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.
